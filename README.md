The UIS-RNN model is originally proposed in the paper [Fully Supervised Speaker Diarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04719).
The UIS-RNN model that is used here is a modification of the original code [here](https://github.com/google/uis-rnn).

The Gostvlad model is originally proposed in the paper [GhostVLAD for set-based face recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09951).
The Ghostvlad model that is used here is a modification of the original code [here](sdfsdfsf).
